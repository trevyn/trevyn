[__Turbocharger__](https://github.com/trevyn/turbocharger) is a project that provides autogenerated async RPC bindings that instantly connect a JS frontend to a Rust backend service via WebSockets and WASM. Get started by using the turnkey [turbocharger-template](https://github.com/trevyn/turbocharger-template/generate), which adds Turbosql, Svelte, Tailwind, and Snowpack.

[__Turbosql__](https://github.com/trevyn/turbosql) works great with Turbocharger; it's an easy local data persistence layer for Rust, backed by SQLite.

Here's some little app experiments that use Turbocharger and Turbosql:
